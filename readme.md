> An awesome list about Java platform Micro edition[(J2ME)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Micro_Edition), a Java specification designed for old keypad phones and PDAs. MIDP is used to create Midlets, which have `.jad` or `.jar` extension, and run on platforms like old keypad phones or PDAs.

Please give it a star(‚≠ê) to support the development. Read about history of Awesome J2ME and above other reverse engineering projects in  <a href="https://hstsethi.vercel.app/posts/programming/awesome-j2me">Awesome J2ME article.</a>
